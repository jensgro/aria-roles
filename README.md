# WAI ARIA roles

Demo version: https://russmaxdesign.github.io/aria-roles/

When WAI ARIA 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation in March 2014, there were four categories for roles. When WAI ARIA 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation in 14 December 2017, two additional categories were added.

This chart shows all WAI ARIA roles including notes on when they changed category, or where newly introduced.
